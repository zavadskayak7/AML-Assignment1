1. The gauss_module.py is a copy of the same file from the Filtering folder.
2. In ex 2a there seems to be a bug in identification.py file. plt.subplot shows different histograms than the real ones in this case, thats why we removed the subplot command.
3. In ex 3c in identification.py file we have slightly transformed the code, in order to perform a grid search over all combinations of hist and dist types.
